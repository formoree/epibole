    "1. Decision trees are a nonparametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation. The hyper-parameter is the he maximum depth of the tree. Create a sklearn decision tree regressor, then generate and plot the validation curve on the *training set* by varying the maximum depth over a sensible range of values.\n",
    "2. Apply the best regressor to the *test set*, interpret the model, and compare its performance to that of multiple linear regression. Suggest one or two ways you may try to improve the decision tree regressor (you do not have to implement them)."
